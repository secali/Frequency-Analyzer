 to make a tool for frequency analysis, which allows the (partial) disclosure of the text and manual change of each letter. Since your tool will only allow partial disclosure of the text, you will be using manual exchange of letters to get the exact decrypted text.

Your tool has to include the following functionality:

Frequency analysis of the encrypted text.
Frequency analysis of the reference text.
With help of the frequency analysis the tool has to (partially) reveal the encrypted text.
Preview of partially revealed text.
Possibility of manual switching letters (NOTE: If for example you replace "a" with "t", the tool has to automatically change "t" with "a", because otherwise you lose trace of letters).
Opening (encrypted text and reference text) and storing the text (decrypted) in a text file.
